# yass

Yet Another Sudoku Solver

## Description

YASS is a pure TypeScript implementation of Peter Norvig's Sudoku Solver with no additional dependencies.
The purpose of writing this program was to learn how to create an efficient sudoku solver that can handle a variety of puzzles using Depth-First Search and Constraint Propagation while learning the TypeScript language.

## Usage

To install the package, run the following command

```shell
npm install yass
```

You can use it in your project by importing that package (CommonJS and ES Modules supported) and creating a new instance of the Solver class.
